      <h2>Wangan Racing</h2>
      <p>
        Wangan Racing refers to racing on long expressways with high-speed stability.<br />
        It was popular in the 80s and 90s, and gained even more heat from the Mid Night Club.<br />
        It started when car enthusiasts in the 70s got their hands on supercars from that era.<br />
        Cars like Toyota 2000GT which is the "first Japanese Supercar", they decided to race<br />
        in non-policed routes like Wangan Highway or the Shuto Expressway.<br />
        In the 90s, a group emerged called the Mid Night Club, they were racers in tuners and supercars.<br />
        They announced races through cryptic texts, but after an accident in 1999, they only do track events.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Popular cars: RUF Yellowbird, Lamborghini Countach, Ferrari Testarossa, Toyota Supra, Nissan GT-R, Mazda RX-7</p>

      <h2>Touge</h2>
      <p>
        Touge refers to mountain pass racing focused on handling and cornering skill.<br />
        It started when minimum wage workers of Japan in the 60s wanted to "test"<br />
        their regular cars on mountain passes. Back then, most cars were budget family cars,<br />
        like station wagons and such. In the 90s, these cars evolved to more high performance Japanese vehicles,<br />
        for example, the Toyota Supra, Honda NSX.<br />
        Also in the 90s, Initial D was invented and the anime gave newfound popularity to Touge Racing.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Popular cars: AE86, RX7, Honda NSX, Toyota Supra</p>
